  <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p> My name is Lukas Vallad and I am currently enrolled in a bootcamp for web development.
      This site is utilized to show my knowledge and growth while learning HTML, CSS and JS.
      Currently, I am mastering HTML and have started learning CSS. </p>
  <h4> Hobbies </h4>
    <p> My current hobbies have been fighting games. I mainly play Melty Blood Actress Again Current Code,
      but more recently have been playing more Last Blade 2. I also enjoy playing the majority of older fighting games.
      I used to enjoy going hiking a lot but with my current work schedule being night shift, it just isn't
      possible to enjoy morning hikes without exhausting myself due to a lack of sleep.
      I do hope with a new job acquired from completing my bootcamp I can work a normal schedule again.
      Then I can pick back up my old hobbies again and hit the gym more. Other than that, I've picked up an expensive hobby of collecting vinyl music albums. </p>
  <h4> Work </h4>
    <p> I currently work at Amazon as a Problem Solver.
      My roll at Amazon consists of me circling the work floor and fix any issues other associates may run into.
      The main issues I fix are inconsistent inventory between physical and virtual, prepping damage products
      and creating tickets for items that are hazmat or require adjustments to their inventory details, such as incorrect item dimensions. </p>

  <h2> Blog </h2>
    <p>I hope to provide insight of my thoughts on my web dev journey here.</p>
    <p> So far I have found HTML really fun and enjoyable. I have a long ways to go before I feel like I've mastered it.
      Ultimately, I'm going to need a lot more practice but doing pages like these always boost my confidence. 
      I will be honest, I feel like embedding a joke link <a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://cdn.wikirby.com/thumb/6/6a/KatFL_Car_Mouth_artwork.png/1200px-KatFL_Car_Mouth_artwork.png">somewhere</a>
      on this page, but I feel like that may be easier to do in the future once I'm more practiced in CSS or even starting JS. </p>
