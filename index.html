                <p> My name is Lukas Vallad and I am currently enrolled in a bootcamp for web development.
                    This site is utilized to show my knowledge and growth while learning HTML, CSS and JS.
                    Currently, I am mastering HTML and have started learning CSS.
                    <p>My current hobbies have been fighting games. I mainly play Melty Blood Actress Again Current Code,
                    but more recently have been playing more Last Blade 2. Other than that, I've picked up an expensive hobby of collecting vinyl music albums.
                    I currently work at Amazon as a Problem Solver.
                    My roll at Amazon consists of me circling the work floor and fix any issues other associates may run into.
                    The main issues I fix are inconsistent inventory between physical and virtual, prepping damage products
                    and creating tickets for items that are hazmat or require adjustments to their inventory details.

                  <h4> Hobbies </h4>
                    <p>My current hobbies have been fighting games. I mainly play Melty Blood Actress Again Current Code,
                    but more recently have been playing more Last Blade 2. I also enjoy playing the majority of older fighting games.
                    I used to enjoy going hiking a lot but with my current work schedule being night shift, it just isn't
                    possible to enjoy morning hikes without exhausting myself due to a lack of sleep.
                    I do hope with a new job acquired from completing my bootcamp I can work a normal schedule again.
                    Then I can pick back up my old hobbies again and hit the gym more. Other than that, I've picked up an expensive hobby of collecting vinyl music albums. </p>

                                    <p>5/16/2023:
                                        CSS can be a pain at times, but with more practice this will come with ease and I'll have my own tricks up my sleeves.</p>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>5/9/2023:
                                        CSS is extremely fascinating. I've started my own personal project using it and its been a total pain in the ass.
                                           However, that is mainly due to me making animations out of pngs for the project.
                                           I just hope I don't burn out, so I can try to have it finished before I start learning Java. </p>
                                    <p>5/2/2023:
                                    So far I have found HTML really fun and enjoyable. I have a long ways to go before I feel like I've mastered it.
                                        Ultimately, I'm going to need a lot more practice but doing pages like these always boost my confidence.

                        I will be honest, I feel like embedding a joke link <a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://cdn.wikirby.com/thumb/6/6a/KatFL_Car_Mouth_artwork.png/1200px-KatFL_Car_Mouth_artwork.png">somewhere</a>
                        on this page, but I feel like that may be easier to do in the future once I'm more practiced in CSS or even starting JS. </p></div>
